Looking into the code we expect that only one query will be executed.
If you pay attention, the query string is not NATIVE SQL, we are using the name of the java classes and attributes to query.
This is called JPQL.

if you don't define the fetch (mode) on ManytoOne default value is EAGER.
Eager means that when we load one club, the stadium and the country must be loaded as well.
This is exactly the select 1+N issue occuring. You want to execute just 1 query, but N queries are being executed behing the scene.
Let's see how it works behind.

The other type of fetching is LAZY. Lazy means that we don't want to load the relationship at the time we load the club, but maybe I will load it after.">

Imagine that this is how JPA looks inside the JVM when we start our case.
At the bottom you can see all the data involved in this case.
2 clubs in yellow, 1 country in red, 2 stadiums in green.

At the top you can find the second level of cache of JPA (It's not used on this test - i will came back to it later).

In the middle you have Entity Manager, the interface exposing methods to communicate with the database.
The entity manager is not thread safe, this means, that each thread will need to work in a different instance of it.

Inside the Entity Manager, we have the Persistence Context (also called 1st level of cache).
Basically it stores in memory all the entity instances of the objects being manipulated within an Entity Manager.

On the right side we have the database.
